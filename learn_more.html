             <p>Customers today are using several sources to find the right local spot for them. Our ListingApe Network focuses on the most powerful sites to help your customers find you. </p>
             <div class="perew">
               <ul>
                 <li>Social Media sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Linkedin – Almost 15% of local searches are done through social media sites. Its simple; friends want to go where their friends check in. Social media is the best form of word-of-mouth. We can help you manage all those accounts with the click of a button.</li>
                 <br />
                 <li>Mapping/Navigation sites like Mapquest – Customers on the go use mapping sites to find and get to your business. With ListingApe.com, you’re ensuring customers your information is correct and no matter what site they use, they will be able to find you and not your competitors.</li>
                 <br />
                 <li>Online Directories like white pages and Cityseach– These local sites are extremely helpful to local businesses but many of them don’t get the information directly from you and your information can be inaccurate. As new directories are created and we add them to our LIstingApe Network, we add your business information making you more visible.</li>
                 <br />
                 <li>Mobile Apps like Yelp! and Foursquare – It is expected that by 2015, the volume of mobile local searches will surpass the volume of desktop local searches. ListingApe.com is the perfect solution since we keep adding sites without increasing your cost.</li>
